# Mega-Robot-Laboratory
Game Editor for Megaman the Wily Wars


Intended features for later on (after v1.0):
 - Music Editor
 - Assembly Programming Editor
 - Built in Emulator for quick testing: Start inside a Level etc. of the Game with current Editor data + Edit while playing
 ... Much much more I'm sure.

~ v1.0 ~  ..(unfinished, and has a ways to go still)
Being worked on (however quite slowly as of right now)
Intended features for this version:

  --- Editing of Game Data ---
  
  Level Data:
  - Level Properties (Gfx Set #, Palette #, Music #, Boss Music #, Level Size, other options, etc.)
  - Matrix (Level Map Layout + Screen Scroll settings)
  - Start and Checkpoint Locations (and to allow game to have unlimited checkpoints instead of its original limit of 2)
  - Graphic 8x8 Tile & Color Palette
  - 16x16 Tiles
  - Rooms (for 16x16 Tile/Block Layout) - (it's like having a large Tile, made of 16x16 Tiles that's 16 Blocks wide, and 15 high)
  - Rooms (for Sprite Layout)
  - BG Image
  - Mid-Level loading of BG Images (BG Map Layout just works as this), Graphics and Color Palette
  - Graphics and Color Palette Animations
  
  Object / Sprite Data:
  - Graphics & Color Palette
  - Mappings (Tile Arrangements for each Frame + Frame Size, Collision Boxes, Animations)
  - Enemy HP

  Title Screens, Stage Select, other Menus
  - ...
  
  Weapon Menus and Weapon related data:
  - Swap which Megaman Games use which Weapon Menus
  - Graphics & Color Palettes (and allow custom Palettes to be loaded, instead of just using the Character Palette as original)
  - Graphic Tile Placement
  - etc.
  
  - Energy Consumption per Weapon
  - Weapon use type (shoot/throw, etc.) and which programming routine # to use (allows to swap which Weapon ID is which Weapon)
  - Which Weapons acquired from Robot Masters
  - ...
  
  
  
  ... Maybe more features.

--- Program Core ---
  - General Configuration Settings
  - Projects (data stored in Files), and Direct Game ROM/Bin editing
  - Project Configuration Settings, also includes the option to override General Config Settings with specific Projects

--- User Interface ---
  - Plenty of well made features to make work very efficient and simple to do
  ... I'll finish writing this soon.
